This is a fun game that lets you click on each card without repeating clicks to see if you can select them all with no doubles.

### Functionality
Start by clikcing on one of the character cards. After each click the cards shuffle and you can click again on a different character. The score of correct guesses is kept at the top of the screen. If you click the same card twice there is a warning at the top of the screen your score resets and the game starts over. If you select all without clicking the same card twice you win!!
